For this task, you need some knowledge of HTML and the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries in Python.
If you have never used the BeautifulSoup library before, use the command mentioned below in your command prompt or terminal to install this library in your Python virtual environment:
(pip install beautifulsoup4)
Here's how the script works:

It first imports the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.

It assigns the Github profile URL to the github_profile variable.

It uses the requests.get() function to send a GET request to the Github profile URL and stores the response in the req variable.

It creates a BeautifulSoup object named scraper by parsing the HTML content of the response, which is accessed through the req.content attribute.

It uses the find() method of the scraper object to find the first img tag with an alt attribute that equals "Avatar".

It accesses the value of the src attribute of the img tag found in the previous step and stores it in the profile_picture variable.

Finally, it prints the value of the profile_picture variable.

Assuming that the Github profile URL provided in the github_profile variable is valid and the profile page contains an img tag with an alt attribute that equals "Avatar", the script should print the URL of the profile picture.
